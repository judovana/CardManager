# CardManager

Originally placed on http://cardmanager.wz.cz/

This is free, open source multiplatform (java) application which allows you to play ANY card game.  <br />
The game is designed especially to play collectible card games like Magic the Gathering or Doomtrooper over network.  <br />
To play those games you need to own (scanned) images of card, which are not part of this package.  <br />
Some can be easily downloadable from internet, but be aware of copyrights.  <br />
The default deck and background is free of copyright  <br />
Also please feel free to add your own backgrounds to ~/CardManager/data/backgrounds and of course enhance collection under ~/CardManager/collection  <br />
